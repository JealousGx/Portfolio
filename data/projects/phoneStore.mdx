I wanted to build a simple yet amazing eCommerce web app. I was familiar with major concepts of web app and how to build an ecommerce site. I implemented the libraries that I knew at that time, in this project and made it as amazing as possible. This web app needs voice / microphone permissions to listen to your voice.

You can see and learn the code [in the project's README](https://github.com/JealousGx/react-phone-store#readme)
