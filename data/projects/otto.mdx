Visiting countries is everybody's dream and many people make this dream come true. They also wish to explore the countries using their vehicles, however, many people do not have their own at that moment. This web app (A landing page) is a shop web app that showcases the vehicles the shop rents. Shop owners can also put the vehicle equipments that one needs to repair their own vehicle.
