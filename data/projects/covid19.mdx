When the pandemic started, I wanted to know about the cases of the whole world as well as some certain countries. As it was the start, there were not many resources to get to this information. I learnt about a disease API that provides the worldwide diseases and their cases in the countries. Utilizing my skills and learning new ones like implementing an API into a React app along with the map, I, along with some help, built this web app. It fetches the latest COVID-19 records of every country, and also displays the data of the previous months.

You can learn more about this web app [in the project's README](https://github.com/JealousGx/covid19-tracker#readme)
