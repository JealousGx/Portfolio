Normally, we want to explore things just by using our voice instead of using our fingers and searching for the things. I personally like to use my voice to search for the things I need, for the ease and convinience. This web application makes it easy to get the latest news just by using our voice. This web app is powered by [AlanAI](https://alan.app) that helps us fetch pretty much everything using our voice.

You can learn more about it [in the github repository.](https://github.com/JealousGx/react-ai-news#readme)
