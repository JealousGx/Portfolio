## How to run:
You need to have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) installed to get everything setup beforehand. The docker file will automatically run everything to setup the container.

##### For those who do not have Docker Desktop:
Just simple clone / fork this repository and run ```npm install --legacy-peer-deps``` as the Node version might not be compatible. After that, simple run ```npm run dev```, and you are good to go.
